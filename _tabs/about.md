Welcome. My name is Michael Thiel, I am 38 years old and come from Rhineland-Palatinate in Germany. My main job is a system administrator, hence my nickname iThieler. In my spare time I'm interested in IT networks in general, home automation and everything related to it, and server virtualization.

This interest started about 8 years ago. A friend had chewed a house and wanted to renovate it "modern". Of course this includes the control of different actuators in different situations. For him it was clear, he does something like that as his main job and since it is all the same, I have some idea of such things. :zany_face:

Since I wanted to deal with this topic for a long time, but as it is nu times so, always lacked the time, I saw my opportunity and used you. :innocent:

As mentioned in the beginning, 8 years have passed since then and since I have a considerable knowledge in this area, as well as in many others, I had decided after some time to let others participate. I got involved in forums and Facebook groups and made my contributions there. But then it happened, in Germany it is said that a carpenter has no cabinets, a cobbler only broken shoes and electricians too few sockets. If I continue this folk wisdom and bring it into the modern, the IT professional has no backups. :cry:

Well, you learn from your mistakes, even the stupid ones. So I decided to start over under the name iThieler. I would be glad, of course only if you have lust, if you participate or support me in my work. Until then ... :smile:<br>
